## About this repository ##

This reposetory is used to store and publish scripts and tools I wrote for my own everyday needs. The files published here **may contain bad code**! So beware if you want to use them in some way. Everything in [dirtpit](https://github.com/gariepinus/dirtpit) was written quick and dirty to tackle some very specific and maybe obsucre problems in my personal setups and environments. If you however should find something useful amongst this mess feel free to use it any way you like. Every file *should* contain a [Beerware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware) License notification.

## Documentation ##

Most of the things I publish in this repository are really simple and have no need for excessive explanations. Nevertheless every file *should* contain a help-string with some basic usage information near its top. If I should find it useful to write down some additional documentation for some files you will find them in this repositories [Wiki](https://github.com/gariepinus/dirtpit/wiki).
